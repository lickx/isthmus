The TCP and UDP sim ports by default use the range 9000..9100 (see etc/isthmus.conf)
They will be auto assigned (picked from this range)

If also using Robust (microgrid), 8002 TCP needs to be open

Your server's FQDN will automatically be used for Robust and ExternalHostNameForLSL
It is advised to set up reverse DNS correctly (make the ip adress resolve to your FQDN),
you usually do that in the web control panel that your server provider offers.

LSL Scripting:
For llRequestURL port 12046 TCP needs to be open
For llRequestSecureURL port 12043 TCP needs to be open

It is strongly recommended to disable ipv6 on OpenSim servers. You do that in /etc/sysctl.conf:

net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1

Afterwards reboot.


Here is an example firewall for an Ubuntu server:

# Set up default rules
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing

# Allow us to manage via ssh
sudo ufw allow ssh

# Enable the firewall: 
sudo ufw enable (press y)

# Set up isthmus ports
# We use TCP and UDP 9000-9100 for the simulators and their regions:
sudo ufw allow 9000:9100

# Allow prim servers to be contacted with http-in - see http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LlRequestURL
sudo ufw allow 12046/tcp

# Allow prim servers to be contacted with http-in - see http://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/LlRequestSecureURL
sudo ufw allow 12043/tcp

# Optional, if you will have a microgrid running Robust:
sudo ufw allow 8002/tcp

# Now you should be all set up:
sudo ufw status verbose
