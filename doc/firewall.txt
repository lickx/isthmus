The TCP and UDP sim ports by default use the range 9000..9100 (see etc/isthmus.conf)
They will be auto assigned (picked from this range)

If also using Robust (microgrid), 8000-8009 TCP needs to be open/public.
8010-8019 are for private robust ports, not to be public. When utilizing multiple
servers (say, to host sims), the private ports need to be accessible by those
servers only.

Your grid home URI (like hg.example.com) needs to have an A record in DNS, not CNAME!
For single small servers, it is usually sufficient to make the A record for the grid
home URI (hg.example.com) the same IP as your main domain (example.com). Any additional
subdomains used by other robust instances (or other stuff like www) can be CNAMEs if on
the same server.

It is strongly recommended to disable ipv6 on OpenSim servers. You do that in /etc/sysctl.conf:

net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1
net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1

Afterwards reboot.


Here is an example firewall for an Ubuntu server:

# Set up default rules
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing

# Allow us to manage via ssh
sudo ufw allow ssh

# Enable the firewall: 
sudo ufw enable (press y)

# Set up isthmus ports
# We use TCP and UDP 9000-9100 for the simulators and their regions:
sudo ufw allow 9000:9100

# This port range should be public for a microgrid:
sudo ufw allow 8000:8009/tcp
(port range 8010-8019/tcp are private ports we use)

# Allow a second server hosting more sims access to private robust:
sudo ufw allow 8010:8019/tcp from 12.34.56.78

# Now you should be all set up:
sudo ufw status verbose
