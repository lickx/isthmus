-- Sorry Wifi is not supported currently --

Long tutorial: http://www.metaverseink.com/blog/diva-addons/wifi-and-other-diva-addons/

When we refer to 'mautil' we refer to the isthmus script bin/mautil which is a handy wrapper for mautil.exe
that already knows where the addin folder is:

./mautil reg-update
./mautil rep-add http://metaverseink.com/repo
./mautil rep-update
./mautil install Diva.Wifi

Add this point, copy etc/addins/Wifi.ini.example to etc/addins/Wifi.ini and open it to edit to your liking

When all is setup, restart robust (./robust restart) and verify in the console (screen -r ROBUST) that
Wifi has loaded. Then you should be able to point a webbrowser to your server at port 8002 and start
using Wifi.
