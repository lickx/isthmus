Addendum to quick-setup

Recent mysql versions are slightly more complex to setup than MariaDB.
Isthmus recommends MariaDB, however if you want to proceed with MySQL,
follow these instructions:

$ cd /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d
$ sudo nano mysqld.conf
(add the following:)
ssl=0
skip_ssl
default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password

Followed by:
$ sudo service mysql restart

Then proceed to make your opensim user:
GRANT ALL ON isthmus_gridname.* TO 'opensim'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH
mysql_native_password BY 'password';

Or modify the one you already have:
ALTER USER 'opensim'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY
'password';

Make sure your isthmus database connection string in etc/database.ini
looks similar like this:

ConnectionString = "Data Source=localhost;Database=opensim;User
ID=opensim;Password=***;Old Guids=true;SslMode=None;
