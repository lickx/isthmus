You'll need the .NET 8.0 SDK
The package name is dotnet-sdk-8.0 in Debian/Ubuntu

The following additional packages are required:

  git
  bash
  grep
  screen
  sed
  unzip
  which
  libgdiplus
  uuid-runtime


In addition, one of the following databases is required:

  mariadb-server (recommended)
  mysql-server


For your own grid and bin/searchpurge, our own OpenSimSearch is needed,
because it prefixes search tables with 'search_' so they can coexist
in the main robust database.
https://github.com/lickx/OpenSimSearch
Do a git checkout lickx-dotnet6, then source webroot/sql/ossearch.sql
into your robust database. In the future I will make all this easier.

For just attaching to OsGrid, OpenSimSearch doesn't use local tables
but speaks to OsGrid's groups server instead. In fact in that case
you won't be using or needing bin/searchpurge.
