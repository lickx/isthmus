; Note that these are regular expressions, not a ordinary string match.
;
; A period means 'can match any single character' - To match a period
; literally, escape them: \\. (We didn't use that for the sake of clarity)
;
; The + (which means 'one or more of the defined character') we used
; because in some cases OpenSim uses two spaces instead of one between
; viewer name and viewer version. Otherwise legit viewers would be locked
; out and see 'Your viewer is banned'.
;
; [0..9] Means any digit 0..9. (\d doesn't work in OS)
;
; Note the OpenSim regexp interpreter needs \ to be double: \\
;
; If only the first part of a version is defined, then it'll match any
; additional string part of the version id. So 6.5.6 will match 6.5.6.12345
; and 6.5.6.67890 etc
